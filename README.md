## Project Description
*A recreation of the New York Times' classic WORDLE game.*

### How to Play:

1. **Guess a Word**: Each round, try to guess a five-letter word. Type your guess into the input field provided.

2. **Submit Your Guess**: After entering your guess, hit the "Submit" button to see how many letters in your guess match the hidden word and if they're in the right position.

3. **Use Feedback**: Pay attention to the feedback provided after each guess:
    - Letters in green are correct and in the right position.
    - Letters in yellow are correct but in the wrong position.
    - Letters in gray are not in the hidden word.

4. **Narrow Down Options**: Use the feedback to refine your guesses and deduce the hidden word.

5. **Win the Game**: You have six attempts to guess the word. If you guess it correctly within the allotted attempts, you win!
